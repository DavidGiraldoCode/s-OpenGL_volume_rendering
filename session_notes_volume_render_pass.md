# Session notes - Volume rendering pass

## TODO
- Review the math for the Beer's Law equations in homogeous participating media.
- Review depth and linearization.
- Change density by sampling a noise function.

## Observations
- The volumetric sphere is rendering behind the camera.
- The transmittance is not changing when the sphere grows. It should decrease visibility.
